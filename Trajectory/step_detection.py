    """
    Function to detect walking steps and estimate step lengths from inertial sensor data. This function combines
    multiple processing stages including peak/valley detection, filtering based on rotation and gyroscope signals,
    and step length estimation using the Z-axis acceleration. The output includes the estimated step lengths and
    the indices of the valid detected steps.

    Some of the implemented methods were based on this article: https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/9/1423
    Such as: regularize_valleys_and_peaks, filter_valid_peaks, compute_step_lengths_by_blocks

    The default values for the peak and valley thresholds, as well as for the moving average window,
    were selected based on empirical observations across multiple subjects.

    :param data: pandas DataFrame containing the sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, rotation).
    :param min_dist: minimum distance (in samples) between detected peaks/valleys.
    :param peak_threshold: Threshold for peak detection, expressed as a fraction (0 to 1) of the envelope's maximum value.
                       Peaks in the original signal envelope must be at least this fraction of the maximum to be detected.
    :param valley_threshold: Threshold for valley detection, expressed as a fraction (0 to 1) of the envelope's maximum value.
                        Since valleys are detected by finding peaks in the inverted envelope,
                        this threshold corresponds to the minimum height these inverted peaks must have,
                        i.e., valleys in the original signal must be at least this fraction below the maximum envelope value.
    :param window_mov_average: window size (in samples) for computing the moving average (envelope).
    :param rotation_change_threshold : Threshold, in deg/s, applied to the derivative of the rotation (angular velocity) signal. It is used to filter out
        steps detected during abrupt orientation changes (e.g., sharp turns)
    :param fs: sampling frequency in Hz.

            - peaks_idx: Indices of detected steps.
